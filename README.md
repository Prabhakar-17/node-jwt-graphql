### Run server
- cd into ./server directory
- run `npm run dev`

### Run web
- cd into ./web directory
- run `npm run dev`

### Go to http://localhost:3000

#### Test user:
username: t5@email.com
password: t12345678

- If you logout and login with a new user, welcome screen for previous user is displayed and this is because the cookie is not reflected. Workaround is to refresh the page manually.
